FADE IN:

A strong BARITONE voice breaks the silence!

VOICE
(Accusing) You, here, Hebron are hereby sentenced to death. And it shall be our entertainment!!

FADE UP:

INT./EXT. THE COLISEUM - SEWERS - DAY

A worn and ragged man, Hebron, stands bound IN chains facing the entrance to THE COLISEUM.

Thousands of wild and screaming fans await the next entrant!

A boot FROM the shadows suddenly kicks Hebron forward into the arena. He collapses to the ground!
